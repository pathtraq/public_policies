# ACCOUNT AND DATA LIFECYCLE

Last updated: October 6, 2023, Effective: October 6, 2023

## Creating and Deleting User Accounts

Pathtraq requires users to create their own accounts. The user's data belong to the account. Once the user requested to delete the account, the account itself and all related data will be deleted after the suspension period.

## Saving Data before Deleting Accounts

We will delete users' data completely when the account will be deleted. So the user has to save its own data by itself before requesting the account deletion.

Users can request track data archive file that contains the entire track data. It must be done before requesting the account deletion.

## Deleting the App from Devices

Deleting Pathtraq app from devices does not delete the Pathtraq accounts. Users have to request the account deletion from Pathtraq app before deleting the app.
